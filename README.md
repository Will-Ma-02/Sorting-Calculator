## Sorting Calculator
A small side project that was made to help understand how sorting algorithms work.
This is currently a work in progress and I don't have an expected completion date yet.
I will update this as I work on it more.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms:
- Bubblesort
- Insertionsort
- Quicksort
- Mergesort

## Sorting algorithms that I plan to add in the future:
- Selectionsort
- Radixsort
- Timsort
