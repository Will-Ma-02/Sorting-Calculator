## Sorting Calculator
There is no doubt that algorithms are one of the hardest topics in all of computer science, due to all the new math, logic and notation that is introducted. Big O, master theorem, comparative sorting, graph theory, P VS NP - it's all too much, and most students struggle as a result.

It shouldn't have to be this way. 

I believe that the problem lies in the way students are taught. We are expected to memorize pseudocode and performance while reading endless pages of mathmatically dense notes. How is anyone supposed to learn if all they do is read about an algorithm but never see it in action? This is exactly what the goal of this calculator is - to provide a way for students struggling to learn list sorting algorithms a more intuitive, hands-on approach to learning about algorithms. Instead of reading, the user is encouraged to experiment and play around with different inputs and algorithms to see what the result is. 

The calculator is run using built-in commands, When you start the calculator, you can type CMDS to see a list of commands. This page will be updated as more work is done.

Make sure to run the SortingCalc.py script to run the program. You can clone this repository or download the files into your own directory.

## These algorithms are currently supported by the calulator:
1. Bubblesort
2. Insertionsort
3. Quicksort
4. Mergesort

## I plan to add these algorithms in the future:
1. Selectionsort
2. Heapsort
3. Radixsort
4. Countingsort
5. Timsort
