## Sorting Calculator
Every computer science major dreads they have to learn algorithms. There is no doubt that algorithms are one of the hardest topics in all of computer science, due to all the new math, logic and notation that is introducted. Big O, master theorem, comparative sorting, grapth theory, P VS NP - it's all too much, and most students struggle as a result.

It shouldn't have to be this way. 

I believe that the problem lies in the way students are taught. We are expected to memorize pseudocode and performance while reading endless pages of mathmatically dense notes. How is anyone supposed to learn if all they do is read about an algorithm but never see it in action? This is exactly what the goal of this calculator is - to provide a way for students struggling to learn list sorting algorithms an intuitive, hands-on approach where instead of reading, the user is encouraged to experiment and play around with different inputs and algorithms to see what the result is. 

I am putting this project on my LinkedIn because this calculator is a huge step in the right direction for me, my friends and future students to come. It shows my open-mindedness to try seeing things from a new perspective - and why it's ok to not understand something right away. The important thing is that you find a way to learn it and not give up along the way. 

The calculator is run using built-in commands, When you start the calculator, you can type CMDS to see a list of commands. The user can type the command NEWLIST to generate a random unsorted integer list, and VIEWLIST to print it out. There are currently 4 algorithms that have been implemented that the user can then run as a command to sort their list.

## These algorithms are currently supported by the calulator:
1. BUBBLESORT (bubblesort), 
2. INSERTSORT (insertionsort)
3. QUICKSORT (quicksort)
4. MERGESORT (mergesort)

## I plan to add these algorithms in the future:
1. Selectionsort
2. Heapsort
3. Radixsort
4. Countingsort
5. Timsort

This is currently a work in progress and I don't have an expected completion date yet. I will update this as I work on it more. Make sure to run the SortingCalc.py script to run the program.
